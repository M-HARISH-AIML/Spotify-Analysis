🎧 Spotify Playlist Analytics Dashboard (Power BI + MySQL + Python)
July 2025 – Personal Project

I designed and developed an interactive dashboard to analyze Spotify track data using Power BI, MySQL, and Python. This end-to-end project involved data extraction from the Spotify API, cleaning and storing data in MySQL, and visualizing it through an insightful Power BI dashboard.

🔧 Key Tools Used:
Python (Spotipy), MySQL, Power BI, DAX, SQL

📊 Key Features:

Extracted and stored metadata for 177+ Spotify tracks (track name, artist, album, popularity, and duration)

Performed data segmentation using calculated columns (e.g., popularity and duration grouping)

Built interactive visuals including:

🎵 Top 10 most popular tracks

👨‍🎤 Top 10 artists by track count

⏱️ Track duration segmentation

📊 Popularity distribution (Very Popular, Popular, Less Popular)

Enabled dynamic filtering via slicers (artist, popularity group, duration group)

Used DAX and Power Query for advanced calculations and formatting

💡 Impact:
Improved data storytelling and reporting by transforming raw audio metadata into clear, actionable insights—useful for content curators, music analysts, and playlist strategists.
